The project is to build a disord server using MYSQL+Python server to maintain all Auth tokens when a request comes from a given discord server, print {"Hello world " + Discord Server name}\
https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1184363661188411454&permissions=2419444753&scope=bot this is the link of the BOT created.\
https://discord.com/invite/6UDe84QU this is the link to the disord server.\
Now when we type !hello in the discord server the bot replies with a message saying Hello world + Discord Server name .
